Version 1.2.1
-------------

* New feature: When `auto_minify_on_save` option is used, `Minify` skips files which already have a .min file
    extension
* Bug fix: Under special cirmcumstances (dirty file open in editor, `save_first` option set to `true`, `Minify`
    got invoked from the menu or keyboard shortcut and not by `auto_minify_on_save` ) `Minify` did not work
    (Thanks to Michael Oakley for noticing and reporting the problem)

# IMPORTANT! #

Please open up a shell window (`Terminal` on Mac OS X, `CMD window` on Windows) and issue the following command:

    npm install -g clean-css uglifycss js-beautify html-minifier uglify-js minjson svgo

followed by:
