Version 1.1.6
-------------

* New feature: Minify settings can be overridden from Project settings
    This allows the use of per project based Minify settings!
* Bug fix: When `auto_minify_on_save` was set to true, the minification
    process was running in the foreground instead in a separate thread in ST3
