Version 1.0.5
-------------

* Changed the keyboard shortcut for the Beautify command because on Hungarian keyboards the previous
  keyboard shortcut ( `ctrl + alt + b` ) made typing a `}` character impossible
  The new keyboard shortcut for Beautify is: `ctrl + alt + shift + m`
* Beautifying now keeps all comments
* YUI Compressor version 2.4.8 jar file is now included, however it is not used by default because it
  has a lot of issues especially under the Windows platform. You can try experimenting with it if you
  wish by specifying which YUI Compressor jar file to use in Minify's `Settings -- User` file.
  See Minify's `Settings -- Default` file for more information
* Added some YUI Compressor related configurable options to the settings file:
  `yui_charset` to be able to specify the charset of css files (default is utf-8)
  `yui_line_break` to be able to specify the maximum line lenght to be used inside minified css files
* Added a new option to keep comments (all or specific ones such as copyright notices) in minified
  javascript files. See Minify's `Settings -- Default` file for more information
