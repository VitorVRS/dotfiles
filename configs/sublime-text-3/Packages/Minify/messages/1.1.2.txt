Version 1.1.2
-------------

* Fixed a syntax error in `Minify.sublime-settings` file (thanks to `handycomm` for reporting it!)
* Added new setting: `auto_minify_on_save`
* Added new setting: `open_file`
    Note: It is advised to set `open_file` to false when you set `auto_minify_on_save` to true.
