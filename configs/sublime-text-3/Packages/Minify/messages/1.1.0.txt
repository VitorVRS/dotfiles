Version 1.1.0
-------------

* Added HTML minification feature using `html-minifier` ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier )
* Added HTML prettification feature using `js-beautify --html` ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify )
* Added support for `clean-css` and `uglifycss` CSS minifiers, `clean-css` is the default now (Java is no longer needed!)
    Note: If you wish to continue using `YUI compressor` for CSS minification then you still
          must have Java installed and add the following line to your `Minify` User Settings:
            "cssminifier": "yui",
* Reworked the README file to give better installation instructions
