Version 1.1.3
-------------

* Added new option to generate source-map files for minified CSS and JavaScript files (thanks to mike-anthony)
    See Package Settings of Minify for details
* Error output is now displayed in an alert box
    E.g: when attempting to minify a JavaScript file containing syntax errors
* Fixed a bug where someone would still try to use the Java-based `YUI compressor` and the `yui_line_break` option
    was not present in Minify's settings file
