Version 1.0.4
-------------

* Fixed an issue which prevented the minification processes to run on the OSX platform
  (The issue was caused by the fact that we must run uglifyjs in a system shell on Windows,
  however runnning the same minification commands in a system shell simply won't work on OSX)
* Fixed an issue which prevented the sublime.set_timeout_async method to be used when available
  (All minification commands still run in the background using python's threading module,
  however it is unnecessary when the sublime.set_timeout_async method is provided, e.g: in ST3)
* Added some debug info to be displayed in the console
